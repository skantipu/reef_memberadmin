1. create contribmethod table in the test db
2. deleting date from contact details tab issue - date tag does not allow us to enter 00-00-000
3. To convert from varchar to date -
update trips set start_date=STR_TO_DATE(start_date,'%m/%d/%Y'); and then change from varchar to date 
Before this you may have to change the varchar size.

4. If default value for date in any of the tables is set to 0000-00-00, then from the front-end if you delete date and update/save, you get an error, as value='' is not accepted.
So, if you have to code so that when value='', set value=0000-00-00. (ex: tr_contact_details mem_since)
